DNA Processes DSL Design for Blocky
Blocks
1. DNA Sequence
Description: Allows the user to input a specific sequence of DNA.
Input: A sequence of nucleotides (A, T, C, G).
Semantics: Stores the DNA sequence for further processing.
2. Replicate DNA
Description: Replicates the input DNA sequence.
Input: None (uses the stored DNA sequence).
Semantics: Takes the stored DNA sequence and creates a complementary sequence. For every A, it adds a T in the new strand and vice versa. Similarly, for every C, it adds a G, and vice versa.
3. Transcribe DNA
Description: Transcribes the DNA sequence to produce mRNA.
Input: None (uses the stored DNA sequence).
Semantics: For each nucleotide in the DNA sequence, it will create an RNA sequence where T is replaced with U (i.e., A->U, T->A, C->G, G->C).
4. Translate mRNA
Description: Translates the mRNA to produce a protein sequence (amino acids).
Input: None (uses the stored mRNA sequence).
Semantics: Reads the mRNA sequence in sets of 3 nucleotides (codons). Each codon is matched with its corresponding amino acid.
5. Introduce Mutation
Description: Introduces a random mutation into the DNA sequence.
Input: Type of mutation (e.g., insertion, deletion, substitution) and position.
Semantics: Modifies the stored DNA sequence based on the type of mutation and position provided.
6. Analyze Protein
Description: Analyzes the synthesized protein for any known conditions.
Input: None (uses the stored protein sequence).
Semantics: Compares the protein sequence against a database of known protein sequences linked to genetic conditions. Flags if any known condition is matched.
Example Usage
The user creates a DNA sequence using the DNA Sequence block.
The user replicates this DNA using the Replicate DNA block.
The replicated DNA is transcribed to mRNA using the Transcribe DNA block.
mRNA is translated to a protein sequence using the Translate mRNA block.
Optionally, a user can introduce mutations using the Introduce Mutation block.
The resulting protein is analyzed using the Analyze Protein block to check for any conditions.
